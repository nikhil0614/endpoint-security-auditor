Remediation Handbook:

1. Root Login Disabled:
   - To disable root login via SSH, add the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
     PermitRootLogin no
   - Then restart the SSH service: 
     systemctl restart sshd

2. No World-Writable Files:
   - To fix world-writable files, use the following command:
     chmod o-w <file_name>
   - Ensure that critical system files are not world-writable.

3. Sudoers File Misuse:
   - Review the sudoers file and remove unnecessary sudo privileges:
     visudo

4. Kernel Parameters:
   - Ensure core dumps are disabled by running:
     sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/dev/null

5. Failed Login Attempts:
   - Investigate failed login attempts in /var/log/auth.log:
     grep 'Failed password' /var/log/auth.log
   - If you suspect malicious activity, review logs and consider changing passwords.
